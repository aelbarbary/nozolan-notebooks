    "### Discussion:\n",
    "In the example above, we kept the __saving attribute private by using double underscores. We created a getter method get_savings() to access the savings instead of directly accessing the private attribute. This ensures that only certain parts of the class can change or access sensitive data.\n",

    "Encapsulation is important because it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps protect the integrity of the data.\n",
    "- Prevents accidental changes to important values.\n",
    "- Provides controlled access to private data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of how we keep our personal life private. We don’t expose all our private actions or wealth to the public, but we share only some. Similarly, in coding, we hide sensitive data and only allow access through controlled means.\n",
