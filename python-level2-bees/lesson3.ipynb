        "\n",
        "Inheritance in Python is a way to create a new class (a kind of blueprint) that automatically gets features from an existing class. This new class can then use, add, or change those features. It helps organize code by letting us reuse common traits and behaviors without writing them over and over.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Big Cat Example\n",
        "Imagine we have a \"BigCat\" class with traits all big cats share, like claws, teeth, and the ability to roar. Then, we create classes for specific big cats, like \"Lion,\" \"Tiger,\" and \"Leopard.\" These big cat classes inherit the shared traits from \"BigCat,\" so we don’t have to redefine claws or roaring. But each of these specific big cats can also have unique features—a lion might have a \"mane\" trait, and a leopard could have \"spots.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is what inheritance does: it lets us make a base class (like \"BigCat\") with shared features, and then build on it with special traits for each type of big cat.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To demonstrate inheritance in python, let's start with the Muslim class. We'll define basic attributes and methods, create an instance of this class, and call methods like pray, fast, save, and calculate_zakat.\n",
