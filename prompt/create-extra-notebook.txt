Design a simple and beginner-friendly Jupyter Notebook for my school to teach coding to kids aged 8 to 15 using Python.

The notebook theme should reflect Islamic values — warm, respectful, and encouraging. Add short welcoming notes or reminders in the introduction (e.g. "In the Name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate").

The notebook must include 20 questions focused on practicing the print() statement.

Each question must follow this structure:

1. A short **Question Text** — clearly explaining the task.
2. A **Code Cell** pre-filled with the comment # your code here to guide students to write their answer.
3. A **Hint Section** — markdown text below the code cell providing a helpful hint or explanation for the student.

Distribute the questions across three types:

- **Write Code** — ask the student to write a small code snippet using print(). Some questions should be inspired by Islamic culture or values, e.g., "Print your favorite Hadith" or "Print the name of the five daily prayers."
- **Find the Mistake** — show a code example with a mistake (syntax or logic) and ask the student to fix it.
- **Predict the Output** — show a code snippet and ask the student to guess the output before running it.

Make sure:
- The language is friendly, simple, and age-appropriate.
- Islamic-themed examples are included naturally (e.g., names like Ahmed, Aisha, mention of Ramadan, daily prayers, Bismillah, and moral messages).

Return the notebook as an .ipynb formatted JSON file.
